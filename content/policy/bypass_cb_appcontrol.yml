  The App Control agent is considered a "real-time" scanner. It also has a self-protection mechanism to ensure that the average end-user cannot disable it. It is important to set up an exclusion policy with your anti-virus (or any other real-time scanning application) to provide proper interoperability.
  This exclusion will also eliminate potential performance issues caused by the AV process constantly scanning the App Control agent cache and transaction log files. Since we are a real-time scanner, these files are constantly being written to.
